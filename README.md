### Hi! I'm a bot.

My enitre purpose is to create issues on [DoctorDalek1963/lintrans](https://github.com/DoctorDalek1963/lintrans).

`lintrans` is an app to help visualize 2D linear transformations, and is designed for A Level Further Maths students and teachers. This means most of the users won't have a GitHub account. However, they should still be able to submit bug reports and suggest new features.

`lintrans` uses Google Forms to allow anyone to fill out an [issue form](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) and then an issue is created under this bot account.

This account itself goes unmonitored. Please direct everything towards [DoctorDalek1963/lintrans](https://github.com/DoctorDalek1963/lintrans).
